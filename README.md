This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications involving unhandled promise rejections within asynchronous middleware.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, where an asynchronous operation (`doSomethingAsync`) might throw an error.  The error handling is incomplete, resulting in a crash if the promise rejects. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution that implements proper error handling using a try...catch block within the async function and a central error handler for Express.js.
